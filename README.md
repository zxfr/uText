uText
=====

uText extends UTFT graphics library and provides a support for converted TTF fonts.

The library is natively supported by Pixelmeister GUI modeling tool. Pixelmeister emulates the library API on desktop computers, converts TTF fonts and images to Pixels-friendly format and exports developed programs prototypes (sketches) to be compiled for a target device.

Update: since Pixelmeister project is currently frozen you can use the command line utility to prepare fonts and images:
