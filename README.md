uText
=====

`uText` extends `UTFT` graphics library and provides a support for converted `TTF` fonts.

The library is natively supported by `Pixelmeister GUI modeling tool`. `Pixelmeister` emulates the library API on desktop computers, converts `TTF` fonts and images to `Pixels`-friendly format and exports developed programs prototypes (sketches) to be compiled for a target device.
